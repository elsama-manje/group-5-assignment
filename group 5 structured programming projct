AUTOMATIC CLAP ACTIVATED LIGHTING SYSTEM
A clap-activated lighting system is an automatic control setup that turns lights on or off when it detects two distinct hand-clap sounds. The system uses a microphone to pick up sound, an amplifier to boost the signal, and a sound-detection circuit ,we can also use microcontroller or timer IC that recognizes the specific clap pattern. When two claps occur within a set time window, the controller sends a signal to a relay or electronic switch, which then powers the light. This design allows hands-free operation, improves convenience in dark rooms, and can be integrated into home-automation systems.

Functional Requiremaents.
1. Clap Detection
The system must detect hand-clap sounds using a microphone.
It must distinguish claps from normal background noise.

2. Pattern Recognition
The system must detect two claps within a specific time interval (e.g., 1–2 seconds).
A single clap or claps outside the allowed interval must not trigger the system.

3. Switching Action
When two claps are correctly detected, the system must toggle the light (ON if OFF, OFF if ON).

4. Signal Processing
The system must amplify and filter the microphone signal so claps are clearly identifiable.

5. Output Control
The controller must send a signal to a relay or transistor to switch the lamp.

6. Power Management
The system must operate reliably from its intended power source (e.g., 5V/12V supply).

7. Status Indication .
The system may provide an LED indicator showing detection, processing, or switching status.


Non-Functional Requirements.
1. Reliability
The system should work consistently without false triggers.
It must operate correctly under typical indoor noise levels.

2. Performance
The system should detect claps within milliseconds.
Response time from detection to light switching should be fast (under 1 second).

3. Accuracy
It should correctly differentiate true claps from random loud sounds.
Sensitivity should be adjustable to reduce false positives.

4. Usability
The user should be able to turn the lights on/off easily without touching anything.
The system should work in darkness where switches are hard to locate.

5. Safety
The relay or switching circuit must safely isolate low-voltage control electronics from mains voltage.
The enclosure must prevent electric shock.

6. Maintainability
Components should be easy to replace or adjust (mic, relay, controller).

7. Scalability
It should support integration into home-automation systems if needed.

8. Energy Efficiency
The system should consume minimal power when idle.
